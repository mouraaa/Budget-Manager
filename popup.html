<!-- NOTES:
The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text

-id total and id limit are both set to "0" which are being used as placeholders to be later changed to whatever the total and limit are set to 
-as a result, the first time a user clicks the extension or the user removes total/limit, it would just show "Total: $0" and "Limit: $0"

-you could have left them both blank or changed to anything by just removing the 0's and the first time a user clicks the extension, it would just show "Total: $" and "Limit: $"
