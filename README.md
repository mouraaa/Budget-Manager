# Budget-Manager
 Tracks spending habits using Chrome's storage API. Users can check their total spent, their limit and overdraft at the click of a button. Users can also update their limit and reset their balance at any desired time. 
 
You can find and download the extension at INCLUDE LINK HERE 

Please note that I was introduced to GutHib later than most people, so there are little to no commits since I am already almost done with this project as of uploading the code to the website.
